        <h3>Websockets and why Ratchet</h3>
        <p> Ratchet is a very well thought-out library for implementing Websockets. In days past in order
            to do some of the really fun interactive stuff we do now on the web with live interactions between users and
            immediate updates from the server to a page, you had to fake it to an extent, or use things like
            those pesky java applets, blech! Here is a good explanation on why websockets are so cool: <a href="https://www.engineyard.com/articles/websocket">Engine - on Websockets</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Ratchet is by no means the only player in the field, However, it does a fine job of making the process just that much easier. Ratchet employs some other libraries that we'll using including <a href="https://pecl.php.net/package/zmq/1.1.2/">ZMQ</a>, and <a href="http://reactphp.org/">React</a> by the same developer as Ratchet. Ratchet requires React to run. As I mentioned there are alternatives and here are a few to look into as well if you are interested.

        </ul>
        <h3 >Getting Ratchet Installed:</h3>
        <p> Ratchet has done a great job of getting you started with a <a href="http://socketo.me/docs/hello-world">tutorial</a>, which I too followed from scratch at first. The main difference between the two tutorials, is that I handle the server process differently for a specifc reason, and  the goal is also a little different: Whereas Ratchet's will guide you though to sending message I've managed the marry two processes, one for sending from the server, and another for client communication.

        <h4>Code this: composer.json </h4>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>

    "autoload": {
    "psr-0": {
    "MyApp": "src"

    "react/zmq": "0.2.*|0.3.*"
    }
    }
</code></pre>
        <p>This goes is your composer.json file located in your root directory where composer.phar is also sitting. You can change the "MyApp" to whatever you want, just make sure that you change the appropriate lines in the files we will generate. MyApp is essentially the location, a folder, under which we're placing our application, that will interact with the classes we're about to downloaded via composer for handling the websockets. Symfony2 being another dependency of Ratchet, Line 3, is going to help us auto load everything we need on the pages we make. Line 3 is the standard they are using (psr-0 is outdated, but messing with this now is outside of the scope of this article ) This file is establishing that location with line 5.  Lines 8-10 are going to load the all classes we need for the websockets.  Now everytime we call </p>

    require dirname(__DIR__) . '/vendor/autoload.php';


</pre>
        <p> We have access to all the classes from Ratchet and React/ZMQ, but also our own application</p>
        <h4><a class="tip">Extra Tip: Errors with ZMQ</a></h4>

        <p>The biggest trouble I had before firing up Ratchet was with the ZMQ extension.  The Ratchet tutorial doesn't get into this so I will - In fact I didn't see it mentioned in the beginning because it's not required by ratchet specifically, but by the react library. The ZMQ extension is very specific to your version of php. If you go to ZeroMQ.org (it's what you'll find if you google the extension), you'll get directed to use http://snapshot.zero.mq/ for windows installs. Don't go there; it's dead anyway. I didn't check the Linux versions. They might be solid, but your best best is to go here, <a href="https://pecl.php.net/package/zmq/1.1.2/windows"">PECL</a>, and download it.  You'll have to determine if you are using a threaded or non-threaded version, and if you're on a 64 bit or 32 bit version of php. Almost for certain, you're running a 32 bit, so, that narrows things down, but the rest could mean trial and error with the right dll. I ended up systematically trying the threaded and non-threaded.</p>
        <p>You might get this if you're using the wrong one</p>

        <h2 class="subheading">Next up: Application Guts </h2>
        <p>Provided you didn't get any further errors, we can move on to the next file. Here were going to write the implementation file for a class that is used in Ratchet to trigger further actions on events such as on connect, on close, on message, etc. The great part about about this file is that it is extensible. We can add more functions as needed, and they are available to us when we later run the process that checks for these events.  For any veterans the way that all works may or may not have been entirely obvious from the beginning, but for me, this is a step deeper into OOP than I've been before. I find the levels of abstraction to be somewhat confusing at first. Since this is a beginners approach, I'll do my best to break it all down. </p>

        <h3>Now we'll take it apart piece by piece:</h3>
        <p> <strong>Lines 2 - 5</strong> are <a href="http://symfony.com/">Symfony</a> constructs, wherein we're first declaring to what "namepace" this file belongs. Since it's part of MyAp, this file should also be located under /src/MyApp The title of the document is unimportant because Symfony is going load everything we put there. Additionally, the "uses" statements are adding the MessageComponentInterface and ConnectionInterface classes we're going to use to the file.</p>
        <p><strong>Line 6.</strong> If you were to look in vendor/cboden/ratchet/src, It has only the method declarations, and none of the functionality we added in the file, hence, class Chat implements MessageComponentInterface.  The MessageComponentInterface.php contains all of the functions in the file we just wrote excepting the last function, which is my addition and about which I'll say more later. </p>
        <p><strong>Lines 9-10</strong> are the constructor function for the class. It instantiates a new SplObjectStorage. This object holds all the connections / users information and this is stored in the variable clients</p>
        <p><strong>onOpen</strong> is rather obvious; its what is going to happen when the user connects to the service. We could trigger other events to happen at this point. Maybe save the users information in a database, start a log etc. At the moment however, it only echos in the console that a connection has been established together with the associated id obtained though $conn->resourceId </p>
        <p><strong>onMessage</strong> Here we get to a key function of the class, the onMessage function. It takes a connectionInterface object (the sender) and a message as arguments. It makes sure that it won't resend this message to the origin, in the foreach statement. The message is pushed it out in real-time to all attached clients via the send($msg) function. </p>
        <p><strong>onClose</strong> This is self-explanatory. If anything else needs to be accomplished upon disconnect of a client, this is where it should go. It calls the detach function on the connection object </p>
        <p><strong>onError</strong> This is self-explanatory</p>
        <p><strong>onNewObject</strong> This is the function that I have added to the system. It's looks redundant in it's form, i.e. it is the in essence as the onMessage function, but its here for demonstration purposes. There is one key difference in the function, and that is, I'm pushing the message to all the clients. Later when we add the ability to push events to all the users directly from the server, not from user to user, we'll utilize this function instead of just the onMessage function. I wanted to show that the same class can be extended with custom functions to achieve more functionality.</p>

        <p> Now that we have everything listening, we can make the remaining pieces. Up first is the server side code that I want to use to push something to all clients who are connected. Because I want to be able to push various types of content to them, I'm going to make it send things in JSON. Specificallly, I wanted to send my users a youtube video.

        <p>I made a simple array just to hold some information that we can send and that is also identifying of the type being setn. When we begin to handle te event on the client side, we'll be using javascript to listen in on port 8080. Lines 10-14 are going to send my array to the port 5555 where we have the service already listening. It's expecting to get a string, so we need to encode the array before it gets sent. We'll subsequently decode it in javascript later.  I could imagine expanding this to keep track of the time the video is playing, and send more content when it's over, or any number of things are possible. Live scores, stock prices, you name it. The instant this script runs it's immediately picked up by all clients attached.</p>

        <h3>Break down: It's alright</h3>
        <p>This file belongs in the bin directory. This time we autoload to get React and Ratchet. We could instead call use Ratchet\Server..etc, but this is why synfony is nice; it's all there now, though it does affect how you make calls to those classes.
        <p>I will try to unpack what is going on in this section in simpler terms. The variable, $loop, is going to call the create function in the Factory class. This starts a loop that will be aware of events we send to it. Next, we store a new instance of our application for later use. Starting on Line 6-10, we initialize the interface in react to use ZMQ. This usage of ZMQ is how it's typically started. There are a bunch of examples <a href="http://zguide.zeromq.org/php:all">here</a>. The only difference is that we're going though the REACT library, a dependency of Ratchet. Next, we are binding this service to a specific port and saying that the only thing it should be listening to is itself, hence 127.0.0.1. We don't want everything sent to 5555 to cause a function to run; just what came from the server itself. The last line, 10, is where we are going to tell it what function to run when it picks up an event on this port. This is where I've designated the onNewObject to run. In the Ratchet tutorials, this is the piece that is used to hook up WAMP methods for server interactions. We don't need WAMP for this application. but we do need that piece, because we don't want our server piece to act like a client; it needs it's own way to communicate with the attached clients.</p>
        <p>However, since only one event loop can be running at any one time in ratchet, we have to pack more into it.  The application we wrote, line 21, is wrapping the following: </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>WsServer</dt>
            <dd>This is going to allow us to do things inside the browser. It utilizes the <a rel="external" href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/">W3C WebSocket API</a></dd>
            <dt>httpServer</dt>
            <dd>This step acts like a buffer to get a complete http request before moving on. Wihout it it doesnt really know what the WebSocket layer is talking about.</dd>
            <dt>I/O server</dt>
            <dd>This stores all the connections, handles the data being trransfered, and errors as well. We could communict using only this piece but then not through the web browser.</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>The wsServer class  set to listen from any source on port 8080, using the same loop as before. The wrapping leads to more functionality. If we needed session management with Ratchet we could warp it in the Session class as well. </p>

        <p> I've essentially combined two process into one file. It is, however, so very confusing to figure out what each piece is returning, and what really happens when it's result is packed into a newly instantiated object. This took a fair amount of trial and error. The good news is that we're done with the hard part. Open up your console in the directory where your /bin/server.php resides and type php server.php . It should start running. Now we need to make a page where the user gets tapped in to all this goodness. </p>

        <p>You can make the following file how you'd prefer. To make sure that the events written as they are show up in the page, you should adhere to the naming conventions I've used. I established two places for content to appear in separate divs, and an input space for sending a message from the client.</p>

        <p>The javascript here is fairly simplistic. Firstly, it listens in on the websocket that we left running. Then the function <strong>onmessage</strong> will pick up anything coming it's way. Depending on the json object sent, we can now make it do different things with that information. The function <strong>sendMsg</strong> does just what you'd expect, It hits the websocket with a message, that message is instantly broadcast to all. At this point it's smart to recognize that have given no though to security. This probably has some big holes.  Given a more robust system for interpretation of the json object, we can give users the ability to immediately affect all attached clients. I'd like to work out a way to allow for room moderation by some, and simple listenting by others. That will be my next challenge!</p>
